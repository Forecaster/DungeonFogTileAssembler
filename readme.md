# DungeonFogTileAssembler

This application takes a folder of map tiles generated by [DungeonFog](https://dungeonfog.com) and attempts to assemble them into complete maps.

## Download
See [Releases](https://github.com/Forecaster/DungeonFogTileAssembler/releases) here on GitHub for the latest downloadable executables.

## Input
It expects the naming scheme to be `MapName_Tile_{n}_{x},{y}.ext` where `n` is the tile index, `x` is the horizontal position and `y` is the vertical position.

The input folder can contain tiles from multiple different maps. They will all be assembled individually.

If one or more tile images are missing the corresponding spots will be left as a blank black spot on the assembled map image.

## Output
A subfolder called `output` will be created in the selected directory and assembled maps will be put here. Finished maps will be named `MapName.ext`, where `MapName` is the first part of the tile name and `ext` is the extension of the tile images.

## Libraries
This program uses Pillow to assemble the images and PySimpleGUI to generate the interface and handle user input.
